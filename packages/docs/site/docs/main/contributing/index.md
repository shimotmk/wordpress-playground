# Contributing to WP Playground project

WordPress Playground is an open-source project that welcomes all contributorsâ€”from code to design, documentation to triage.

## How can I contribute?

-   Code? See the [developer section](/contributing/code).
-   Documentation? See the [documentation section](/contributing/documentation).
-   Reporting bugs? Open a [new issue](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/new) in the main GitHub repository, or in [Playground Tools](https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/issues/new).
-   Ideas, designs, or anything else? Open a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/discussions), and let's talk!

## Guidelines

-   As with all WordPress projects, we want to ensure a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone. Please read our community's [Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/) to learn more.
-   Code contributors should review the [coding principles](/contributing/coding-standards).
-   You maintain copyright over any contribution you make. By submitting a Pull Request, you agree to release that code under [WordPress Playground License](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground?tab=GPL-2.0-1-ov-file#readme).

## Triaging issues

Want to help sort through open issues and resolve potential bugs? Here's how:

1. Review the [list of open issues](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and find the ones that you can help with. Same goes for the [Plaground Tools repository](https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).
2. Read through the description and comments.
3. If it's a bug you can reproduce, add a descriptive comment or a potential fix.
4. Otherwise, add a comment with any additional information that may be helpful.

## A note on contributing and the GPL license

WordPress Playground and the WordPress project are strongly rooted in free and open source software. Specifically, WordPress Playground is licenced under GPLv2 (or later) from the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/). You can [read the text of the license here](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/trunk/LICENSE) and if that feels overwhelming, WordPress.org has a [friendly GPL Primer](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/gpl-primer/).

As such, please be aware of the implications your contributions will fall under:

-   When you contribute, you agree to license your contributions under the GPLv2 (or later) license
-   The GPL license has strong copyleft provisions that ensure all derivative works remain open-source and under the same license terms, thereby promoting a collaborative development environment.
-   The GPL license encourages contributing any changes, bug fixes, or new features back to the original codebase.
-   The GPL license ensures that the project remains free and open-source, not only in terms of cost but also with respect to the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software.

If you have any questions about how the above might effect your contributions, please feel free to reach out on WP Slack and the [`meta-playground` channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C04EWKGDJ0K).

Thank you again for your contributions! ðŸŽ‰
